## Summary and Reflection

Summary:
I have selected orange as the color for displaying the question and green for displaying the answer. Kindly use the Pixel 8 Pro emulator for best results.

Reflection:
I always wanted to pull data from a JSON file but never tried it before this assignment. Didnt know it would be soo easy, yet soo exciting to implement.
